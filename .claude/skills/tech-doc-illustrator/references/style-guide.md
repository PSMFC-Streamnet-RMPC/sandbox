# Illustration Style Guide

## Core Philosophy

**Confident minimalism for technical clarity.**

Every illustration should:
- Explain a concept, not just decorate a page
- Be immediately understandable
- Look hand-drawn but professional
- Use restraint - say more by drawing less

## Visual Language

### Line Work
- **Confident black lines** - Drawn with purpose, not hesitation
- **Slight imperfection** - Small wobbles suggest human touch, not machine precision
- **Consistent weight** - Primary lines bold, secondary lines thinner
- **Clean intersections** - Lines meet deliberately, no accidental overlaps

### Composition
- **White space is content** - Empty areas are active participants, not voids
- **Centered or rule-of-thirds** - Clear focal point
- **Breathing room** - Elements never feel cramped
- **Visual hierarchy** - Most important element draws the eye first

### Color Application
- **Sparse accent color** - 10-20% of the illustration
- **Color for meaning** - Highlight what matters, not random decoration
- **Flat fills only** - No gradients, shadows minimal
- **Consistent across set** - Same color = same meaning throughout docs

## Illustration Types

### Diagram
Clean technical diagrams with simplified shapes.
- Boxes, circles, arrows
- Clear labels when needed
- Logical flow direction (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
- Connection lines show relationships

### Scene
Contextual environment illustrations.
- Minimal background elements
- Focus on the primary subject
- Suggests context without overwhelming
- Often includes desk/workspace elements

### Icon
Bold, recognizable symbols.
- Centered composition
- Maximum simplicity
- Works at small sizes
- Single concept per icon

### Process
Step-by-step visualizations.
- Sequential flow (numbered or arrowed)
- Each step visually distinct
- Progress indicated by position
- Start and end clearly marked

### Architecture
System architecture diagrams.
- Layered components
- Clear boundaries between systems
- Connection types visually differentiated
- Scale suggests hierarchy

### Concept
Abstract metaphorical representations.
- Physical metaphor for abstract idea
- Immediately graspable meaning
- Simple but clever
- Avoids clichés

## Do's and Don'ts

### DO
- Keep it simple enough to sketch on a whiteboard
- Use consistent visual metaphors
- Make the main point obvious
- Test comprehension: "Can someone understand this in 3 seconds?"
- Consider how it looks in dark mode (if applicable)

### DON'T
- Add decorative elements that don't convey meaning
- Use more than one accent color
- Include unnecessary detail
- Make illustrations that require legends to understand
- Use photorealistic elements mixed with illustrations
- Rely on color alone to convey meaning (accessibility)

## Technical Documentation Context

### For Configuration Documents
- Show settings as dials, switches, or sliders
- Use amber for "adjustable" elements
- Keep technical details in text, not illustration

### For Architecture Documents
- Boxes for services/components
- Lines for connections
- Clouds for external services
- Database cylinders are acceptable
- Layer from user-facing (top) to infrastructure (bottom)

### For Troubleshooting Documents
- Show the problem state clearly
- Use coral to highlight error/problem areas
- Arrow pointing to solution when applicable
- Before/after can work well

### For API Documents
- Request/response as arrows
- Endpoints as boxes or circles
- Use teal for data flow direction
- Keep payloads abstract (don't show actual JSON)

### For Process/Workflow Documents
- Clear start and end points
- Decision diamonds for branches
- Numbered steps for sequential processes
- Use accent color for the current/focus step

## Aspect Ratio Guidelines

| Ratio  | Best For                                        |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| 16:9   | Hero images, wide diagrams, architecture views |
| 4:3    | Standard documentation images, process flows   |
| 1:1    | Icons, social sharing, thumbnails              |
| 3:2    | Blog post images, balanced compositions        |
| 9:16   | Mobile/vertical displays, step sequences       |
| 21:9   | Wide banners, panoramic system views           |
